# Semantic HTML

Semantic = The meaning of words

Relevance of Semantic HTML:  
_Accessibility_ - This is important because you can be sued for not having a website that is accessible to those who are vision impaired.  
_Developer_ - Ergonomics - When others or yourself look at your code in the future, it has more meaning to have specific HTML tags in a certain order than it does to have, say, a million divs. It improves the readability of the code.
_Machine Readability_ - This is important because it increases the ability of search engines to display your website or parts of your website.  

MDN Element Reference - Reference for HTML5 Element Tags including deprecated ones.
