# CRUD using Rails API  

By the end of this note, you should be able to: Write Rails Actions for CRUD Methods  
HTTP Requests come in to the Router, which looks for the Method and the Path.  
The Router redirects incoming requests based on the method (GET, POST, etc.) and the Path (url).  
It redirects to a controller action (create, destroy, etc.). The controller interacts with the database using the model. The action completes and sends an HTTP Response back.
