# Mod2-Notes
This is a collection of READMEs I am writing which detail topics we cover in Mod 2 of Flatiron School.



Part | Birthdate | Expiration Date | Rationale
---|---|---|---
HTTP | 1991 | 2100? | Used for like, everything on the web. This is one thing I think will probably outlast all the others, unless some revolutionary new model comes out for communicating on the web.
HTML | 1993 | 2075? | Like HTTP, it has been used since the dawn of the web basically. It's the backbone of every website. I think it would take a revolutionary technology to supplant it.
CSS | 1996 | 2075? | Cascading Style Sheets are nearly synonomous with HTML these days, so I think CSS will last just as long as HTML will.
Javascript | 1995 | 2075? | Like CSS, it is used by a lot of websites and since the death of Flash, has been enjoying a renaissance. I think this, too, will stick around until HTML dies.
bash | 1989 | 2050? | Yet another piece of technology that I doubt is going anywhere any time soon. It's the default login shell for most UNIX distributions (although I technically use 'zsh' on my personal laptop)
Linux | 1991 | 2050? | I use Ubuntu on my laptop and I have no idea what distro my webhost server is run on. Regardless, Linux is open-source and used for tons of stuff, so I doubt it is going anywhere. I just started using Linux like a month ago though, so I don't know generally how breaking major updates are.
Solid State Drive | 1991 | 2050? | Hard to know since Solid State drives are a relatively new technology. I would guess at least as long as a hard disk.
Bluehost Webhosting Services | 2003 | 2040? | The service I use to host my website. I have no idea how long they will last, but it better be at least 3 years from now because that's how long I've purchased with them.
VS Code | 2015 | 2030? | Also a relatively new piece of software, I would guess that this will be supported by Microsoft for at least 5 years if not much longer, given its current popularity
GitHub | 2008 | 2030? | Another piece of technology that is extremely popular and currently managed by Microsoft, I doubt this will go anywhere for a while.
